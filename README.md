## Learnings and Issues
Some of the learnings I'm taking away from this project are:
1. An issue I ran into with this project was deployment. getting the Heroku app deplyoed using MongoDB Atlas. Also, at times my Service Worker file was throwing errors (I realized I was including uncessesay files in Service Worker doc.)

## Future Application Updates
* Create easy-to-use edit and delete buttons for transactions, giving users the option to update their previous transaction history.
